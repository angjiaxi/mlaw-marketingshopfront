## Singapore International Commercial Court 

The [Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC)](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/) offers parties the option of having their international commercial disputes adjudicated by a panel of experienced judges, comprising specialist commercial judges from Singapore and international judges from both civil law and common law traditions. Parties who wish to resolve their disputes at the SICC can do so even where the dispute has no connection with Singapore and is not governed by Singapore law, as long as the original parties submit to its jurisdiction under a written jurisdiction agreement.

**Why Choose SICC?**

The SICC offers innovative features which cater to the needs of international parties and differentiate it from other Courts. 
The SICC complements existing international arbitration services. Parties may choose to resolve their disputes at SICC if they:

•	Prefer that all adjudicators are independently appointed. In SICC proceedings, the Chief Justice assigns judges from the panel of International and Singapore judges to each case. In most arbitrations, arbitrators are generally appointed by parties to the arbitration.

•	Desire to have a right of appeal, as decisions of the SICC may, by default, generally be appealed to the Singapore Court of Appeal. Parties may, however, contractually limit or waive their right of appeal. 

•	Require third parties to be joined in the proceedings, especially in multi-party situations.

•	Prefer that the proceedings take place in open court and published judgments with clear grounds of decision.

**A diverse panel of eminent international and local jurists**

Disputes before the SICC and any resulting appeals will be heard by judges drawn from a distinguished and diverse panel. The panel is made up of eminent local and international judges and legal experts, with many of the international jurists being current or former judges from various jurisdictions. 

**Enforceability of judgements**

As judgments of the Supreme Court of Singapore, SICC judgments will be [widely enforceable around the world]:

•	In common law countries and some civil law jurisdictions, enforcement will proceed without review of the merits of the case. 

•	SICC judgments can also be registered and enforced in the Courts of countries which have reciprocal enforcement arrangements with Singapore, such as Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. 

•	SICC judgments may be recognised and enforced in the Courts of the states which are party to the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. This includes the EU member states, Denmark, Mexico and Montenegro. 

**Choice of counsel**

Parties are not limited to appointing Singapore lawyers and are free to choose foreign counsel to represent them in cases with no substantial connection with Singapore. Foreign counsel may also appear to address the Court on matters of foreign law. 

To appear before the SICC, foreign counsel must [register with the Court](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/registration-of-foreign-lawyers/registration-of-foreign-lawyers) and comply with the [SICC Code of Ethics](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/guide-to-the-sicc/code-of-ethics_revised.pdf).

**More flexible court procedures**

Court procedures in the SICC follow international best practices for commercial disputes, and provide for more flexibility than typically found in national court processes:

•	**Confidentiality**: Parties may apply for their case to be heard in confidence. Where a case has no substantial connection with Singapore, the Court will generally take a more liberal approach in granting confidentiality orders.

•	**Rules of evidence**: If all parties agree, they can have the flexibility to apply to the Court to adopt other rules of evidence they are familiar with, such as the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.

•	**Determination of foreign law**: Parties may apply to have questions of foreign law determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof. This means that they will not have to call witnesses to prove what the foreign law is.

•	**Document production or discovery**: Instead of general discovery, the document production or discovery rules in the SICC are similar to the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.

•	**Costs**: Costs are awarded at the discretion of the Court, with the general principle that the unsuccessful party shall pay the reasonable costs of the proceedings to the successful party.

**What are the SICC’s fees?**

Fees will be based on factors including the type of hearing, number of hearing days and the number of judges hearing the case. Detailed fee information can be found in the relevant [Rules of Court](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/legislation-rules-pd/rules-of-court).
