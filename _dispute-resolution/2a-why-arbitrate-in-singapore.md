> Singapore is the foremost venue in Asia for international arbitration. Singapore ranks as the most preferred seat in Asia, and the third most preferred seat globally after Paris and London, in the 2018 Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL) International Arbitration Survey, a major empirical survey on the use of international arbitration. 

The international arbitration regime in Singapore enjoys a unique combination of competitive advantages:

## An open regime

Parties are free to engage lawyers and arbitrators of any nationality and use any governing law. There is no restriction on foreign law firms engaging in and advising on arbitration in Singapore.

## Enforceability of arbitral awards

Singapore is a party to the [1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards](http://www.newyorkconvention.org/english). This means that arbitral awards issued in Singapore are enforceable in the courts of over 150 Convention countries.

## Modern and responsive laws

Singapore’s arbitration legislation is regularly reviewed to keep abreast of international best practices and commercial developments.

Singapore’s arbitration legislation adopts UNCITRAL Model Law provisions, including those empowering the Court to grant interim orders in aid of foreign arbitration. 

Singapore was one of the first jurisdictions to provide clear legislative support for the appointment of an emergency arbitrator, and for any resulting order. The emergency arbitrator procedure enables parties to obtain urgently required interim relief before a Tribunal is constituted, without the need to go to Court. 

Singapore has also amended its laws to permit and facilitate the use of third-party funding [Note: to provide a link] in international arbitration proceedings and related court and mediation proceedings

## Cost advantage and tax incentives

Arbitration costs in Singapore are, in general, lower than most major centres of arbitration. As part of building a robust and vibrant legal services hub, Singapore offers arbitration-specific tax exemptions for non-resident foreign arbitrators. 

## Rich talent pool 

Singapore law firms rank among the world’s best international arbitration practices, according to widely-followed rankings by the [Global Arbitration Review](https://globalarbitrationreview.com/). Growing numbers of global law firms have chosen to base international arbitration practice group offices here. A number of leading and established barristers’ chambers now have a permanent presence here, giving parties a wide choice of experienced counsel to select from. The majority of law firms included in Chambers & Partners Asia Pacific Guide 2019 rankings[Note: to provide a link] have a presence in Singapore.

## Judicial support

There is strong judicial support where the judicial philosophy is to accord a substantial degree of judicial deference to the outcomes and processes of international commercial arbitration in recognition of party autonomy.  In Singapore, our courts have been slow to assume jurisdiction over a matter that the parties have agreed to refer to international arbitration, intervening only where appropriate and necessary to do so, and within the framework provided for by the New York Convention and our International Arbitration Act.

Where the arbitration matters are brought before the High Court, specially-appointed judges, who have the experience to handle a wide range of complex issues, preside over them.

## Professional arbitration standards

The [Singapore Institute of Arbitrators (SIArb)](https://www.siarb.org.sg/) provides professional training and development, such as the International Entry Course, Fellowship Assessment Course and Graduate Certificate in International Arbitration. It also works closely with Singapore International Arbitration Centre and other partner organisations to organise talks, seminars and training courses for members and the public on a regular basis. Besides being a centre for promoting knowledge on arbitration and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, SIArb also acts as an appointing authority for the appointment of arbitrators upon requests.
