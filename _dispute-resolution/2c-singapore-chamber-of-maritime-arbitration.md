## Why choose SCMA?

**Hybrid Model of Arbitration**

The SCMA Arbitration Rules are based on a hybrid model of non-administered arbitration with optional features. The optional features that parties may utilise are (1) appointing authority, (2) determining challenges to the tribunal, (3) fund-holding services, and (4) authentication of awards under the Singapore International Arbitration Act.

**Specialist Maritime Rules**

The SCMA Arbitration Rules are created by and for the maritime and international trading communities. They are kept simple and current with feedback from the industry. SCMA also maintains specialised arbitration rules to cater to technical marine disputes such as the Singapore Bunker Claims Procedure for bunker quality or quantity disputes, and the SCMA Expedited Arbitral Determination of Collision Claims for collision disputes.

**Panel of Expert Maritime Arbitrators**

SCMA Panel Arbitrators are drawn from all sectors of the local and international maritime community, all of whom are experts in one or more maritime disciplines. SCMA arbitrators hail from diverse nationalities and jurisdictions and can conduct hearings and render awards in different languages. Admission to the SCMA Panel of Arbitrators is not dependent on nationality, jurisdiction, or affiliation.

**Freedom of Appointment**

Users have complete autonomy to appoint arbitrators of their own choice or from SCMA’s Panel of Arbitrators. They may also request the assistance of the SCMA Chairman to break a deadlock in an arbitrator appointment or determine a challenge to an arbitrator.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

There are no fees payable to the SCMA to commence an SCMA arbitration. There is also no mandatory scale of arbitrators’ fees based on the amount in dispute (also known as ad-valorem fees). Parties are free to independently agree upon rates with the arbitrator(s).

**Inclusive Membership Base**

Membership is open to all companies and individuals from all sectors of the maritime and international trade communities. SCMA Members actively participate in various SCMA committees and events to ensure that SCMA remains responsive to the needs of the industry.
