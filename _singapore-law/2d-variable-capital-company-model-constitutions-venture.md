The Variable Capital Company (VCC) is a corporate entity which can be set up as a single standalone fund, or as an umbrella fund with two or more sub-funds, each holding different assets. 

To facilitate VCC adoption, the Singapore Academy of Law has developed two model VCC constitutions for use for private funds, one for a VCC structured as an open-ended fund; and one for a VCC structured as a closed-end fund. The [model constitutions](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/About-Singapore-Law/VCC-Model-Constitutions) will provide a starting point for law firms and other professional advisers and fund specialists advising their clients on the VCC structure, greatly reduce the time for incorporation of a new fund as a VCC and assist funds which are domiciled in other jurisdictions to re-domicile in Singapore as VCCs.  It will also assist in overcoming initial investor unfamiliarity with the VCC structure.
